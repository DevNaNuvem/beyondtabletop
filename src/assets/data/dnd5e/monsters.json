Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.\n\nWhile in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight. \n**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. \n**Misty Escape.** When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.\n\nWhile it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point. \n**Regeneration.** The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn. \n**Spider Climb.** The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. \n**Vampire Weaknesses.** The vampire has the following flaws: \n_Forbiddance._ The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants. \n_Harmed by Running Water._ The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water. \n_Stake to the Heart._ If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed. \n_Sunlight Hypersensitivity._ The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\n\n## Actions\n\n**Multiattack. (Vampire Form Only).** The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack. \n**Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18). \n**Bite. (Bat or Vampire Form Only).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. _Hit:_ 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control. \n**Charm.** The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bite attack.\n\nEach time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect. \n**Children of the Night (1/Day).** The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.\n\n## Legendary Actions\n\nThe vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The vampire regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. \n**Move.** The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. \n**Unarmed Strike.** The vampire makes one unarmed strike. \n**Bite.**(Costs 2 Actions). The vampire makes one bite attack.",

The new body appears within 5 feet of the mummy lord's heart. \n**Spellcasting.** The mummy lord is a 10th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). The mummy lord has the following cleric spells prepared: \nCantrips (at will): **sacred flame, thaumaturgy** \n1st level (4 slots): **command, guiding bolt, shield of faith** \n2nd level (3 slots): **hold person, silence, spiritual weapon** \n3rd level (3 slots): **animate dead, dispel magic** \n4th level (3 slots): **divination, guardian of faith** \n5th level (2 slots): **contagion, insect plague** \n6th level (1 slot): **harm**\n\n## Actions\n\n**Multiattack.** The mummy can use its Dreadful Glare and makes one attack with its rotting fist. \n**Rotting Fist.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic. \n**Dreadful Glare.** The mummy lord targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummy lord, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies and mummy lords for the next 24 hours.\n\n## Legendary Actions\n\nThe mummy lord can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The mummy lord regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. \n**Attack.** The mummy lord makes one attack with its rotting fist or uses its Dreadful Glare. \n**Blinding Dust.** Blinding dust and sand swirls magically around the mummy lord. Each creature within 5 feet of the mummy lord must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of the creature's next turn. \n**Blasphemous Word (Costs 2 Actions).** The mummy lord utters a blasphemous word. Each non-undead creature within 10 feet of the mummy lord that can hear the magical utterance must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the mummy lord's next turn. \n**Channel Negative Energy (Costs 2 Actions).** The mummy lord magically unleashes negative energy. Creatures within 60 feet of the mummy lord, including ones behind barriers and around corners, can't regain hit points until the end of the mummy lord's next turn. \n**Whirlwind of Sand (Costs 2 Actions).** The mummy lord magically transforms into a whirlwind of sand, moves up to 60 feet, and reverts to its normal form.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. \n**Breath Weapons (Recharge 5–6).** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons: \n**Fire Breath.** The dragon exhales fire in an 90-foot line that is 10 feet wide.

Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it. \n**Change Shape.** The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. \n**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check. \n**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack. \n**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.

While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns.\n\nIf the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone. \n**Tentacle.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +17 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target. \n**Fling.** One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone. \n**Lightning Storm.** The kraken magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 120 feet of it. A target must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n## Legendary Actions\n\nThe kraken can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The kraken regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. \n**Tentacle Attack or Fling.** The kraken makes one tentacle attack or uses its Fling. \n**Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions).** The kraken uses Lightning Storm. \n**Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions).** While underwater, the kraken expels an ink cloud in a 60-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than the kraken. Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of the kraken's next turn.",

      "text": "**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the tarrasque fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. \n**Magic Resistance.** The tarrasque has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. \n**Reflective Carapace.** Any time the tarrasque is targeted by a **magic missle** spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the tarrasque is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the tarrasque, turning the caster into the target. \n**Siege Monster.** The tarrasque deals double damage to objects and structures.\n\n## Actions\n\n**Multiattack.** The tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and one with its tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite. \n**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tarrasque can't bite another target. \n**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +19 to hit, reach 15ft., one target. _Hit:_ 28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage. \n**Horns.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +19 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. _Hit:_ 32 (4d10 + 10) piercing damage. \n**Tail.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +19 to hit, reach 20ft., one target. _Hit:_ 24 (4d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. \n**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the tarrasque's choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. \n**Swallow.** The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque's turns.\n\nIf the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.\n\n## Legendary Actions\n\nThe tarrasque can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The tarrasque regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\n\n**Attack.** The tarrasque makes one claw attack or tail attack. \n**Move.** The tarrasque moves up to half its speed. \n**Chomp (Costs 2 Actions).** The tarrasque makes one bite attack or uses its Swallow.",
