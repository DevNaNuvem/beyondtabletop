  <h1 class="hh1">Alpha vs Beta and Lite vs Premium</h1>

  <p>When you open up your Dashboard you'll see a number of different tools you can create. Each one is labeled with its type in parentheses. The types and what they mean are listed and explained below</p>

  <h2 class="hh3 tmr-60">Beta</h2>

  <p>A tool in Beta means it's still in development. The tool will receive occasional updates, and will rarely undergo major changes. The data you enter in these tools is fairly safe and stable.</p>

  <h2 class="hh3 tmr-60">Alpha</h2>

  <p>Tools in Alpha are still being formed. We don't show Alpha tools to all users by default, but you can use them by enabling Alpha Mode in your <%= link_to "account settings page", edit_user_path %>. By using this tool and <%= link_to "giving feedback on our subreddit", SiteConfig[:social][:reddit] %>, you can help improve the tool's development process from an earlier stage. Keep in mind that tools in Alpha are likely to change drastically, so data may not be preserved from one version to another.</p>
