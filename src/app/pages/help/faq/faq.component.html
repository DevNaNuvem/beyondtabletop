  <h1 class="hh1">What is Beyond Tabletop?</h1>
  <p>Beyond Tabletop is a set of tools for RPG players who want to enhance their in-person game sessions with cleanly designed, easy-to-use online character sheets and maps. Our web application is subscription-free and designed to be used on all devices. We currently offer several products:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>D&amp;D 5e character sheet</li>
    <li>Pathfinder character sheet</li>
    <li>Generic RPG character sheet, which can be used for any system</li>
    <li>Battlemap tool, which is designed to accommodate many RPG systems</li>
    <li>Campaign tool, designed to make GMs' lives easier and organize all other tools</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="hh3 tmr-60">How much do your tools cost?</h2>
  <p>Thanks to the tremendous and <a routerLink="/donate">generous support</a> of players like you, these tools are completely free!</p>

  <h2 class="hh3 tmr-60">Is this just another spreadsheet?</h2>

  <p>No, our tools are built on a realtime platform called Firebase. Basically, this allows you to create files that save in real time, so your friends can open and see the changes happen as you make them. The character sheet tools are not spreadsheets; they are fully-customized sets of fields automatically pulling in data from the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/" target="_blank">Pathfinder SRD</a> and D&amp;D 5E resources, while calculating inputs designed specifically for those systems' respective players.</p>
  <p>And because all files are read-only by default, that means they can be shared with just a link. All you need to view a tool is a Google account. You can create a Beyond Tabletop RPG battlemap, share it with other Beyond Tabletop users, and use it at the same time!</p>

  <h2 class="hh3 tmr-60">Can I use my own images for the map?</h2>
  <p>Yes. We don't offer image storage, but you can upload images anywhere publicly-accessible (like <a href="http://imgur.com/" target="_blank">imgur</a> or <a href="https://www.getcloudapp.com/" target="_blank">cloudapp</a>) and use the image URL in the RPG battlemap.</p>

  <h2 class="hh3 tmr-60">Will this work on my phone or tablet?</h2>
  <p>Yes, it works on any device that can normally render a website. Beyond Tabletop is a web application so you're free to play on your phone, tablet or computer!</p>

  <h2 class="hh3 tmr-60">Can I print my character sheet?</h2>
  <p>Technically, yes, you can, but it's not perfect. For both the D&amp;D 5E and Pathfinder sheets, printing them will print a version of your Overview tab. Beyond Tabletop's products are meant to be used online and digitally, so transferring them to print media is not something we currently fully support.</p>

  <h2 class="hh3 tmr-60">How do I delete my data/account?</h2>
  <p>Please make a request via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondtabletop" target="_blank">reddit message</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/99xNTE7" target="_blank">discord message</a>. I take care of all requests right away.</p>
